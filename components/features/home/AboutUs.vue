                WanderWork is a tech startup founded at Sync The City 2024. Pitched by Sarah Roberts, the idea was to
                build a platform for travellers to find work while they travel. Inspired by Sarah's own journey as she
                struggled to traul through outdated websites for hours on end, she outlined a clear gap in the market.

                The team at WanderWork is made up of a diverse group of individuals from all walks of life. We are
                passionate about travel and technology and are dedicated to making WanderWork the go-to platform for
                travellers and hosts alike.
